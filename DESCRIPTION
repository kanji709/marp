Description: To implement a model-averaging approach with different renewal
    models, with a primary focus on forecasting large earthquakes. Based on
    six renewal models (i.e., Poisson, Gamma, Log-Logistics, Weibull,
    Log-Normal and BPT), model-averaged point estimates are calculated using
    AIC (or BIC) weights. Additionally, both percentile and studentized
    bootstrapped model-averaged confidence intervals are constructed. In
    comparison, point and interval estimation from the individual or "best"
    model (determined via model selection) can be retrieved.
